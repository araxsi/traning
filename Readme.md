About

Data Science | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Forecasting Analytical | Deep Learning | Data Warehouse Architect

I ensure that organizations use their data assets to their greatest potential to support business operations. My goal is to show how an organization can make data-driven decision-making processes, make a healthier decision on the development of a business strategy, and integrate these decisions into all areas of activity. Use best and appropriate practices, market research, and competitive analysis to formulate strategic direction and business strategy for machine learning and AI technologies.

Developing and transmitting a data vision in the organization is a critical part of our growth strategy. Develop and implement a central data strategy to build strategic models and increase revenue. I ensure the correct use of data. Not only do I work as a data scientist and data engineer to acquire and produce high-quality data-driven models, but I also help businesses make better data-driven decisions.

I have years of expertise in providing data quality solutions that are the foundation of any data-driven system. I grow in fast, onset environments.
